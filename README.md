## About the Book

Conversation as an interface is the best way for machines to interact with us using the universally accepted human tool that is language. Chatbots are one of the flavors of Conversational UIs. Chatbots are real-time, data-driven answer engines that talk in natural language and are context aware. Basically conversational UIs boils down to two types one that provides services and the other is for entertainment purposes. This Book will cover both these types of Conversational UIs by leveraging APIs from multiple platforms. We'll take a project-based approach in understanding how these UIs are built and the best use cases for deploying them.
